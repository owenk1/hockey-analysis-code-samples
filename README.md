# hockey-model-code-samples

This repository is intended to showcase code that I've written for various hockey projects, including an RFA contract projection model (with classification and regression components for term/cap hit, respectively) and a query to aggregate early saeson performance of 18-year old rookies.

These samples represent a small subset of my capabilities and the projects I've worked on. Other projects are omitted here due to their sensitive & proprietary nature, but I would be happy to discuss them further where appropriate in private.

Thank you & please reach out (@owenkewell on Twitter) with any comments or questions.
